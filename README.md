# voter-predctions
Interactive Dash app hosted on Render [here](https://interactive-voting-predictions.onrender.com/). It displays the candidate voting probability heatmap determined by a Gradient Boosted Decicion Trees model, by state, updated according to user responses.

Some feature importance analysis is explored in [feature_importance.ipynb](https://github.com/nathankolling/voter-predctions/blob/main/dashboard_model.ipynb), and the model building is done in [dashboard_model.ipynb](https://github.com/nathankolling/voter-predctions/blob/main/feature_importance.ipynb).

The actual app is in [app.py](https://github.com/nathankolling/voter-predctions/blob/main/app.py), although the CSS stylesheet is excluded.
